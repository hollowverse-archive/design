# Hollowverse Design [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hollowverse/design.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hollowverse/design)

This repo contains the UI/UX of Hollowverse, which is showcased at
[https://hollowverse.github.io/design](https://hollowverse.github.io/design).

While UI/UX is commonly communicated in the form of images, the UI/UX of Hollowverse is
communicated through code authored in React, JavaScript, and CSS. That code lives in this repo.

The actual front-end production code of hollowverse.com lives in
[hollowverse/hollowverse](https://github.com/hollowverse/hollowverse), and it may produce somewhat
different results from what is in this repo.

## Contributing to Hollowverse UI/UX

We use [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to showcase Hollowverse UI/UX.

To run Hollowverse Storybook locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repo, and `cd` into it
1.  Install dependencies `yarn install`
1.  Run `yarn start`
1.  Open `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`
